          <h4>Henry K. Young</h4>
          <p>
            is 22 years old from Portland, Oregon. He is a student at Whitman College majoring in Theory and Practice in Digital Design. The individually planned major
            combines new media art, computer science, and art history with a focus on modern art and architecture. He realized he was interested in design in highschool after taking 
            a summer course at Sci-Arc. Henry uses processing, figma, and various coding languages to create interactive interfaces, reflecting his Brutalist inspired style. He is 
            familiar with python, C++, java, and html/javascript. Henry hopes to explore a career in User Experience Design or Architecture.

          <h4>Human Computer Interaction</h4>
  
            <p >
              Manifesto:
              <br><br>
              To extend my previous manifesto, I think a guiding principle behind my work is honesty and functionality over aestheticization. This is inspired by my work with Brutalist architecture and Contemporary Brutalist Design. In Modernism functionality can become problematic because, as we have seen, there are several design paradigms that forgo culture and emotion for ergonomics and ease of access to information. To me, functionality doesn’t necessitate physicality or industrial connotations, it can simply mean that there is a process by which to follow that can be followed time and time again and be applied to any design problem. 
              <br><br>
              We have explored many different processes in the class, including methods of ideation and for critiquing and analyzing designs, which are all helpful and should be a part of any good designers repertoire. Whether it is scientific and logical, or entirely playful and convoluted, there needs to be a process to get from start to finish. In both of my website redesigns, I focussed a lot on the medium, or the screen size and device, in the design of my projects. For the multitouch display, I divided the screen into four because the device was built that way. For other creative usages, breaking the boundaries of those frames would have been really fascinating, but for the website, the goal was to show the necessary information. On the apple watch as well, I had to pay attention to the size of the device and make sure the interactions were appropriate. Throughout both of these projects though, the scope of my thinking was much larger. I was thinking about the separation of responsibilities, and what if we could make a design system that could apply to all the screen sizes rather than tackle them individually. Improving my figma skills was a huge stem towards realizing those possibilities. I was also considering the implications of frontend and backend in website design, and how that could translate to dishonesty. My websites are designed consciously so that their behaviors are all laid out to the viewer, nothing is hidden or obscured. In this way, there is a functional basis and process to solve a very existential problem. With my data visualizations, all the information is available to the user. 
              <br><br>
              In many variations of antidesign, the core argument is not that pretty things are bad, but that pretty things are used to lie. The rounded corners and bright colors of apple and google hide a consumer enterprise using child labor and selling personal information for capital. Sharp corners, while they are not inherently honest, usually reveal that there is more attention being paid to the message, the content, than to the sugar coated surface. I think that people don’t often understand the vision of these movements and it frustrates me. Every dystopian movie ever made begins with the prettiest facade, only to reveal the horrifying underlying dynamics. Every time someone complains about a Brutalist building in favor of a white glass building it infuriates me. How long does it take for people to realize that an aggressive appearance doesn’t mean it has aggressive intentions. 
              <br><br>
              Not so different from many modernists, the aspirations of my projects are very large. On my design projects my eyes are often bigger than my stomach. For the other world project, I had hoped to make a disorienting alternate reality using html and the iphone camera. This proved to be much more difficult than I foresaw. On the redesign and extend project, I had hoped to make design system and use it to make every screen size interactive, this also proved to be too large a task. While I need to learn to be more realistic with my undertakings, my aspirations and scope will never shrink. My process will forever be to tackle these large cultural issues from a functional basis.

                Our goal for the project was to see how we can transport the user into a different world. We accomplished this by changing the environment that surrounded them with a single event in A-Frame. Henry proposed that we create the different environment through an AI generator called “ASCII” (https://ascii-generator.site), which transforms the original library image into monochrome pixels. We then overlapped this new layer onto our original image. During the coding process, we applied an event where using the user's cursor would make the 1st image disappear. By doing this, it would enable a new view for the user, as if they’ve been transported into a unique dimension. Mateus used the animation event on A-Frame, where the user’s cursor location initiates a transition between one image from the other by visibility. The demo video included in the post explains our process in doing so.

                Design Process:
                <br>
                <br>

                We initially planned to develop the project outside A-Frame because of its limitations. However, while the process was ongoing, we learned that our HTML skills couldn’t suffice the initial plans. We thought about changing the camera data of the user so that they could experience multidimensional travel, but that was hard to figure out. Therefore, because of A-Frame's basic tools, we decided to commit to the project using that framework. While looking through A-Frames “entities”, I noticed that the skybox can be manipulated by the user, which was crucial for the change of environment. However, the question was “how” the skybox could be interacted with. The approach to this was using a mouse click function. But, after an hour of finding a mouse click function for A-Frame, we couldn’t find any information on that. The alternate plan was to use the location of the mouse instead of clicking. Therefore, to initiate the change of the skybox, the mouse had to be focused on a button. We didn’t have opportunity to get feedback before the publication of the project. But, with our best judgement, we liked the function of the concept. It was quite the experience overall!              <br>

              For this project, I decided to look the correlation between knowledge of the past and optimism about the future. After learning about Nirvana in one of my classes, I became really interested in generational attitudes, especially regarding optimism and apathy. The first study included only the percentage of each category of knowledge that thought the world would be better off. To get a more accurate picture of the data, I wanted to see what proportion of people fit into which category, so I did some research and found the original study. The data is presented above.
              <br>
              <br>

For my sketch, I wrote a program in processing that draws a grid representing the data. Originally, I was planning on trying to represent the data with brains or some other representation of knowledge, however this proved to be too complicated in processing. I did, however, use the same color scale they used to represent no knowledge through very good knowledge, red through green respectively. I made it so that the data would determine the drawing, meaning you could adjust the proportions/numbers and the grid would change accordingly. I also made the grid respond to mouse position, so that when you move the mouse from left to right the sample size grows so that you can see small sample sizes and large ones. I was surprised to find that sample size affects my perception of the proportions, suggesting that we don’t see proportional data as objectively as we think. I also made it so that you could hover over the specific category of development knowledge and it would isolate that group so you could see the proportion of optimists to pessimists on their own. Originally, I wanted to make it so that you could only see the proportion of optimists to pessimists when you hovered over the category, but ultimately I decided that it was more beneficial to see the data as a whole so that you could derive the conclusion of the data more easily. While I don’t agree with the data necessarily, it suggests that people with more knowledge of world events and the past are more optimistic about the future of the world than those with less knowledge. I think this representation appeals to our senses and emotions because it encourages a certain level of playfulness and experimentation in the interaction. The ability to affect the way the data is presented also gives the user more flexibility and customization, allowing them to see the data in a way that is most understandable to them.<br>

              Bhow we evaluated the original design
              The original design did not include many of the visual factors that have been presented in this project, therefore, this was an idea that was heavily improved for this project. One visual factor I’m referring to is that, now, the icons are different for each frame shown to provide a unique feeling to the user. However, one problem was that it was hard to match the visuals for the Apple Watch dimension because of its small resolution. My interest was to match the visuals for all dimensions in order to achieve consistency, so I persevered through this issue and provided a friendly user interface.The original design did not include many of the visual factors that have been presented in this project, therefore, this was an idea that was heavily improved for this project.

              the methods and process.
              our old design two months ago was remaking the Whitman CS website. Since we are evaluating and redesigning a project, we decided to commit to a project we have the most similarity in, which was remaking a website. We also decided on creating the same dimension that we committed to last time. For me, I did the laptop dimension for my old project, so I decided to remake it again. Since we were all familiar in Figma, this was an advantage for us. We had the knowledge to maneuver through the system without much issues. Therefore, we were able to execute most of the functions that we had in mind, such as, scrolling and interactable buttons.
              <br>
              <br>

              A description of how you evaluated the final, updated design (methods as well as findings).
              In evaluating the final design, we categorized information in certain areas depending on the dimensions. For instance, for the multi-touch dimension, different tabs are located on the sides and information is presented in the middle of the screen. With visual cues, the information that is presented can easily be distinguished through the color, font, and size. We also included the logo at the same location for every frame. However, as explained before, it was hard to do if some dimensions are too small (Apple Watch).
              <br>
              <br>

              Reflections on the overall process.
              The overall process was swift, we were all assigned a dimension to do (since only three were required) and made sure that our design was consistent with one another. Once done we all reviewed and tested each others dimension. I had to make multiple edits to the Apple Watch design because I felt that some of the text sizes were too small or big after reviewing it, but other than that, we didn’t have to change much.

              In my design for dimensions project, I focused on the large multi touch display. I chose these dimensions of a screen because it seemed like a wonderful challenge designing for a screen much larger and much less common than what is widely used at the moment. The format meant that you would be able to fit a lot of information onto one screen, but it meant that you would have to be wise about how you presented that information so as not to overwhelm the user. Using the example of the Microsoft surface hub, I saw that the screen is split into four parts, which was a useful limitation. As shown in my mood board below, I used TV and multi tasking layouts for inspiration as they organize large lists and a lot of information in a way that is still understandable to the user. The end result is an interface with four simultaneous pages that can be mixed and matched freely, while still being resemblant of a typical website.
              <br>
              <br>

              Mood Board
              As interesting as having text and images that would span a massive screen would be, in this case it would be impractical and would negatively impact the viewing experience. Consequently I chose to use the guidelines provided and divide my layout into four parts as well, giving us four smartphone-like ratio screens to work with. I decided to make a main page, a page for faculty, a page for courses, and a page for the facilities. While the dense pages with large paragraphs are still necessary for the website, I chose pages with images and lists as they lend themselves better to demonstrating the multi touch scrolling interface I was designing. As for the aesthetics of the project, as a group we decided to follow the example of the Whitman website fairly closely, focussing more on the functionality and the compatibility with the screens than with the look of the website. Many assets of the design process could be shared and reused between members of the group while others had to be completely reworked in order to fit the screen.
              <br>

              In terms of the overall layout, many of the decisions had to do with the usage of space and the necessary information. The screen is large but meant to be viewed from a distance, so text and images need to be the correct size. For many of the pages the concept was to have primary information ready to be viewed from a distance and the secondary information with much more detail to be available in pop up boxes if needed. I experimented with several different ways of presenting the information, as can be seen in my sketches below, and ultimately concluded that in most cases it makes sense to contain the modules/pieces of data within boxes in order to give the user a prompt/sign that it can be tapped for more information.

              I had several ideas that I wanted to incorporate that I wasn’t able to implement within the relatively short timeline we were given. If I could build on the project, I would make the prototype have alternating tabs so that any tab of the design could be placed anywhere on the screen. This would take either a considerable amount of time or a professional level of Figma experience. I would have also liked to make variable list components that would expand when tapped and resize the items in the list accordingly. This would also be very ambitious, as this takes a deep knowledge of figma components and auto layout that I am less familiar with. The more complicated interactions we were able to implement were dialogue/pop up boxes with more information, as well as scrollable lists. This makes the prototype far more realistic and immersive when demonstrating our design.

              Overall, I wanted the website to still look and feel familiar while making use of this new format. Compared to the other screen dimensions, this allowed for a lot of flexibility in terms of how to display the information. However, when given an exciting new format like this, it is important to keep the information digestible and not overdo the possibilities of a larger screen. The website is similar to the current Whitman website in that it is professional and welcoming, but this new site allows for a better hierarchy/system of organization and it makes far more information accessible at any given time.              <br>
