                        In this project we were tasked with finding a cultural phenomenon that we were passionate about. Being in Milan, I wanted to choose something specific to Italy that was timeless and overlapped into many other domains of life and culture. While exploring the city, I came across a vintage glasses shop called Foto Veneta Ottica. I chose this shop as my project because it is both a functioning business and something that, to me, provided a cultural experience similar to a museum. Throughout the course, we learned about strategies for digital engagement specifically for cultural institutions like museums. I thought that Foto Veneta Ottica could benefit from some of these methods. 
                        <br><br>To me, glasses encapsulated part of the experience of Milan. Glasses are the convergence of style, design, culture, heritage, and Italy is one of the three biggest regions in the world for the production of high quality glasses. For my digital engagement project I designed a logo, two sets of declinations, and the prototype concept of an interactive interface for inside the physical store of Foto Veneta Ottica. The introduction of the interactive interface represents a comprehensive shift in branding from solely a profit oriented company to a learning experience. By introducing an interactive screen like those used in museums, it would enhance the buying process, making it tailored to the individual and geared towards browsing and education. The new visual identity of the company better reflects this new approach.
                        <br><br>Rather than trying to overhaul the existing store experience, I decided that introducing an interactive screen like those in museums could enhance it without disrupting it. When you enter the store, there are one or two sales representatives to assist you through the process, who have to help you open every case and help you find anything in the drawers behind the desk. The store is organized by shape and brand. If you know what shape and brand you are looking for already, the salesperson can help you far more, but if you don’t have an idea of what you want you are reliant on them to browse. The interactive interface serves as a means of storing and displaying all the information of the store’s collection to encourage exploration. The user wouldn’t need to have any prior knowledge about frame shapes or fashion brands to find what they are looking for. When trying on and comparing glasses, it is easy for frames to accumulate on the table. The interface would make it possible to like or favorite the pairs that speak to you. The intention is not to replace the sales team, it should compliment and assist them. The charm and character lies in the people who work there, and the interface should not detract from their role. The interface would contain all the history/specs behind each of the frames and provide interesting information to make the customer feel more engaged. But to try on the glasses and see them in person, you still must interact with the salesperson. The interface could instruct the customer on what might fit their face shape the best, but ultimately direct the user to the salesperson for that help. Matching a face to a shape of glasses is a nuanced skill that the salesperson should retain.
                        <br><br>For the sake of the exercise, we had to come up with a name for our experience. I ultimately decided on the name Archive Occhiali because it communicated the most with the fewest words. Foto Veneta Ottica is an establishment that values simplicity and elegance, therefore using the fewest words seemed in line with the company values. The key concepts I wanted to get across with the name was that it is not just an establishment selling glasses, but that glasses are a connection to design, fashion, and culture, and that this establishment seeks to highlight this. I also wanted to make it clear that the store contains a wide variety of frames both old and new, and that this store can teach you about the various differences between the eras. I chose archive as the first word because it did the best job at getting this message across. Lastly, I considered several different options to communicate “glasses,” finally settling on Occhiali. Between optics, lens, frame, and glasses, I chose Occhiali because it did the job of communicating the Italian heritage of the shop. Foto Veneta Ottica is closely tied to the Veneto region of Italy. Using both English and Italian in the title could communicate a multi faceted, worldly, and inclusive attitude.
                        <br><br>For my first draft logo of Archive Occhiali I used the text ‘Archive Occhiali.’ I thought that type might emphasize its cultural significance and heritage better than a logo would. It also presented the opportunity to preserve some of their existing brand identity. I chose to use an upper and lowercase serif typeface similar to the typeface on their current business card. For my second rough draft of the logo I decided to adapt the glasses on the Foto Veneta Ottica Iinstagram picture. The pair of glasses were strange with one lens being square and the other circular. Rather than make a vector from scratch, I manipulated the image directly, giving the logo more imperfections and personality. I thought this image captured the assortment of  strange, unique, and rare pairs of glasses that you wouldn’t be able to find anywhere else. Lastly, I think the circle and the square are two elementary shapes that could represent the educational value of coming into the store. One limiting factor of this logo, in my opinion, is that it doesn’t do as good of a job communicating the antiquity side of the brand image. My last attempt at a rough draft for the logo was meant to be a more modern twist on the old logo of the brand. On their business card they have a sketch-like image of a frame that does a good job of communicating antiquity, but in my opinion it doesn't capture elegance. I chose this starting point not only because it is part of the pre existing visual language of the company, but also because this particular glasses frame is a timeless shape that captures the essence of the old and the new. Then I adapted it, playing with the lines and the forms to create something different. I experimented with the exclusion boolean operator, which created some interesting lines, giving it a more modern design oriented feel. 
                        <br><br>The final draft of my logo is an adaptation of the first and third rough draft logos I developed. I wanted to stay as true to their existing visual language, gearing it towards the new emphasis on learning. I decided to combine the type with a pair of sunglasses in order to grab your eye. This element makes it clear to anyone, speaking any language, exactly what the product is. Including Occhiali and the sunglasses logo makes it clear that it is an establishment of Italian heritage. The decision of which frames to use was a difficult one, I liked both options equally but in the end these frames fit better with the font and were more timeless. After experimenting with the lines and the forms of the original frames, I decided that the lines from the exclusion were distracting and didn’t fit with the core theme of timelessness, antiquity, and elegance. I experimented with several different textures and strokes and came with a grainy and blurry texture that mimics the texture of acetate and a stroke that overlaps the body of the glasses with the arms. Acetate is a classic material in the field of opticianry that was introduced in the forties. The overlapping stroke gives an xray effect that could be associated with truth and education. Finally, I kept the logo monochrome so that it could be more flexible. 
                        <br><br>In the end, I chose to make three posters for print, three animated digital ads, as well as the prototype for the interactive interface. The visual design for all of these components revolved around three main guiding values. One aspect of the visual language is quantity and education. Photo Veneta Ottica boasts an astounding ten thousand pairs of glasses, each with something to learn from. I want to achieve this in a delicate way using patterns and repetition, moving to reveal information. Often in visual merchandising, quantity communicates lower prices and lower quality. To combat this, I would be focussing on one main pair of glasses to highlight the individual. Lastly, visuals will highlight the institution's identity is elegance and antiquity. 
                        <br><br>The shape of the frames captures the old frame in an exciting and timeless way. The examples of fashion posters in my slideshow show the importance of highlighting the individual in connection with their pair of glasses. This personal relationship and exclusivity are what I want to play with in the branding and the interface. 
                        <br><br>My first set of declinations are inspired by the old fashion ads from armani, gucci, and prada. They each delineate an intriguing looking individual who wears a pair of glasses that perfectly fits their personality and style. Drawing a connection between style/fashion and sunglasses makes people realize that there is an opportunity to express their own individuality. In other words it makes them feel that the brand appeals to them as an individual. The three individuals represent many demographics, making anyone feel like they are welcome and have a connection to the brand. In each of the declinations there is a logo placed in the upper corner. In the first two the logos are black, however in the third declination I used a grey logo to maintain high contrast. 
                        <br><br>In my second set of declinations I created dynamic animated posters. The first is a pair of glasses centered in the middle of the screen, with a number of grey rectangles that float across the screen, revealing some aspects and concealing others. The rectangles reveal the store of Foto Veneta Ottica, as well as the essential shape of the glasses frames. They slide over and cover the other less important aspects of the glasses like the lenses and the ear pieces. They also reveal a different style of text that moves slightly in relation to the preexisting text at the bottom of the page. These aspects are meant to represent the learning experience possible with the new digital interface, revealing new exciting aspects of the glasses that couldn’t be known previously. The second digital promotion is similar to the first, however in this declination the three components of the glasses are repeatedly moving back and forth. As they do, they function similarly to a telescope of some sort. As they compress, the background comes into focus and the display cases grow as if they are coming to the foreground. As they expand, the opposite happens and the cycle continues. Playing off the idea that glasses are meant to improve your vision, it is meant to represent the change in perspective and the “new look on life” you will have when coming to the store. Using a theme of rectangles closely connected to symbolize the drawers, display cases, and other containers they use for the glasses frames, it achieves the feel of an archive. The third declination shows a pattern of repeated glasses and triangles repeated over the frame. I reused the glasses frames from my second logo rough draft. The glasses have one square lens and one circular lens. Adding the triangle, they use the elementary shapes to represent the learning experiences that can be gained from visiting the store. The shapes look like buttons from an old scifi movie, fluctuating in different colors. This is another way of showing the store's new digital approach. 
                        <br><br>The final piece in the visual identity of the store is the interactive interface. Going into the design process, I wanted the interface to be a place to browse through all the pairs of glasses digitally, but didn’t take away from the experience of feeling and trying on a pair of glasses. The user could set a pair of glasses on the interface and it could tell you all of the information about that pair, and tailor information specifically to the individual. It would show all of the historical and cultural information to strengthen the relationship between the individual and the glasses, as well as the individual and the institution. I wanted to keep the interface manageable yet contain as much information as possible. The final product came out just as I hoped. In the top right corner, there is a circular module to set the glasses upon. The interface then reads the information of the code and displays the corresponding information in the central text box, the specs off to the right, and the blueprint above the text. To the left, there is a menu that can be dragged to the center of the page which then allows you to browse through the entire selection by category. This lets the customer browse without needing any prior knowledge. The visual language of the interface is meant to communicate modernity while still feeling at home in the antiquated environment. In some cases like the large text boxes, a more modern typeface was needed. In others, such as the buttons of the dragging menu, an older font looked more appropriate. In the background, I used a purple grid pattern to make it feel like a digital interface. For the text and the visuals, I used a grainy overlay to give it more of an older look and feel. The side menu was inspired by the display cases and drawers that contain the glasses in the store. Finally, the logo is placed in the top left corner of the display. 
                        <br><br>Utilizing the methods used by cultural establishments to engage their customers, the logo and declinations create a complete rebranding for Foto Veneta Ottica. Shifting into a digitally enhanced learning environment with the interactive interface, customers can browse through all of the store's products and absorb all the cultural content surrounding each and every pair of glasses. With the two new sets of declinations, Foto Veneta Ottica can spread word about Archive Occhiali: a new digital approach to cultural education regarding opticianry.

                    <p>In the final for my visual merchandising class in Milan, we applied our new knowledge of fashion window displays. After analyzing a fashion brand of our choosing, we designed a window display in accordance with our diagnosis and their brand image. In this project I chose to analyze Uniqlo, a Japanese brand offering colorful basics. After researching the brand, their customer persona, and their competitors, I decided that Uniqlo could benefit the most from more recognizability and brand loyalty. Relating to the urban market through the aesthetics of their city could develop a sense of loyalty, and utilizing the flexibility of their wide color ranges could create striking harmonies by complementing the colors of their cities visual identity. With my window display, I used photoshop to recreate a closed back diorama-like display of the Milanese subway system. I used a mannequin dressed in red clothing and a blue Uniqlo sign to complement the red and yellow coloring of the subway. I photoshopped all of this into the existing Uniqlo store Milan to make it as realistic as possible.

                        For this assignment of my Human Computer Interaction course, we were tasked with making an data visualization that appeals to the senses.  I decided to look at the correlation between knowledge of the past and optimism about the future. After learning about Nirvana and Grunge in one of my other classes, I became really interested in generational attitudes, especially regarding optimism and apathy. The first study included only the percentage of each level of knowledge that were optimistic about the fate of the world. To get a more accurate picture of the data, I wanted to see what proportion of people were in each level of knowledge, so I did some research and found the original study. The data is presented above.
                        <br><br>
                        For my sketch, I wrote a program in processing that draws a grid representing the data. I used the same color scale they used to represent little knowledge through very knowledgeable, red through green respectively. The lighter colors in the data represent the optimistic members of that group while the more muted ones represent the more pessimistic ones. I made the grid respond to mouse position, so that when you move the mouse from left to right the sample size grows so that you have the choice of seeing small or large sample sizes. I made it so that proportions in the data would determine the drawing, meaning you could adjust the sample size or the size of the grid and the numbers would change accordingly. I personally find that sample size can affect my perception of the proportions, and maybe having dynamic data would provide a more thorough understanding of that data. I also made it so that you could hover over the specific category of knowledge level and it would isolate that group so you could see the proportion of optimists to pessimists on their own. While I don't necessarily agree with the data, it suggests that people with more knowledge of world events and the past are more optimistic about the future of the world than those with less knowledge. I think this representation appeals to our senses and emotions because it encourages a certain level of playfulness and experimentation within the interaction. The ability to affect the way the data is presented gives the user more flexibility and customization, allowing them to see the data in a way that is most understandable to them.
