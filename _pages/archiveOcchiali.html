        <h1>Archive Occhiali: Cultural Experience through sunglasses</h1>

        <h3>Digital Interface to enhance cultural impact of vintage glasses shop 
        <a href="#solution"><span>Jump to solution-></span></a></h3></h3>

        <p><span>Role: </span>Sole designer <br>
            <span>Duration: </span>3 Months <br>
            <span>Completed: </span>May 2022<br>
            <span>Skills: </span>Ideation, prototyping, strategies for digital engagement
        </p>

        <h2>Choosing a subject/client</h2>

        <h3>During my time in Milan, taking a course on Strategies for Digital Engagement, our semester long project was to select a cultural experience that we found meaningful and promote it by applying modern branding strategies. I selected a vintage glasses store called Foto Veneta Ottica as the subject of my project.</h3>

        <ul>
            <span>Reasons for choosing Foto Veneta Ottica</span><br>

            <li>small business local to northern to Italy</li>
            <li>Italy is one of the three biggest regions in the world for the production of high quality glasses</li>
            <li>convergence of style, design, and heritage</li>
            <li>niche product but still widely used</li>
            <li>existing business makes my work more tangible</li>
            <li>already has similarities to museums and therefore could benefit from similar strategies</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Room for Educational Experiences</h2>

        <h3>In the absence of a study group, I used my own personal perspective from the buying process to inform decisions about which strategies to use. It was difficult to account for the different cultural attitudes to retail environments and shopping behavior between Italy and the United States, but as this project is all about exposing people from all around the world to this cultural experience, I think my perspective could still be of value. </h3>

        <p>
            <span>Heavy reliance on sales representatives</span>
            <br>Representatives have to open every case and help you find anything in enclosed drawers. They are also the only source of information on the frames
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Roadblocks to exploration</span>
            <br>The store is organized by shape and brand. If you know what shape and brand you are looking for already, the salesperson can help you far more, but if you don’t have an idea of what you want you are reliant on them to browse
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Limited store space</span>
            <br>Because there are limited display cases, hundreds of pairs are hidden in drawers, out of view and inaccessible to the customer. When trying on and comparing glasses, it is easy for frames to accumulate on a small table.
        </p>

        <h2>Prompt: create a cultural learning experience</h2>

        <h3>While many of my classmates opted to make a limited time event such as a popup or a convention, I wanted to challenge myself to make an experience that could be integrated into the existing store. Throughout the course, we learned about strategies for digital engagement used by cultural institutions like museums. One strategy that inspired me was the application of digital interfaces. Because Foto Veneta Ottica has so many similarities to museums, I thought it could also benefit from a digital interface in the store. Introducing an interactive screen could serve as an outlet for customers to learn about glasses as part of Italian culture.</h3>

        <ul>
            <span>Benefits of an interactive interface</span><br>
            <li>could store all information regarding the stock of the store</li>
            <li>reduce roadblocks to exploration</li>
            <li>store clerks wouldn’t have to waste as much time supervising</li>
            <li>frames wouldn’t accumulate as much</li>
            <li>display information to customers in an accessible and exciting way</li>
            <li>provide opportunities for deeper, personal connections with the products, and by extension the brand</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Guiding Concepts</h2>

        <h3>The qualities or values that dictated the design decisions surrounding core motifs for my branding and visual storytelling</h3>

        <p>
            <span>Elegance and Timelessness</span>
            <br>A core aspect of the institution's identity (as well as the industry as a whole) is elegance, heritage, and antiquity. They have a range of new and old glasses; trying to capture timelessness and balancing old with new is a challenge I want to set for myself
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>“One in a Million”</span>
            <br>Photo Veneta Ottica boasts an astounding ten thousand pairs of glasses. Often in visual merchandising, quantity comes with an assumed lower price and lower quality. I want to challenge this assumption by showing a mass quantity of product while still highlighting the importance of the individual pair of glasses and the customer’s potential connection to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Learning </span>
            <br>Making the pairing between customer and glasses more intellectual, value oriented, rather than solely oriented around aesthetics. There are also several ways I can experiment with visually communicating the potential for learning.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Name </h2>

        <h3>The store already had its own company name, but as part of the branding the experience created by the digital interface needed a name of its own. </h3>

        <ul>
            <span>Considerations</span><br>
            <li>simple and elegant, using the fewest words for memorability</li>
            <li>balancing between old and new</li>
            <li>communicating the sheer quantity of stock and the multitude of information regarding each pair</li>
            <li>learning experience</li>
            <li>digital interface</li>
            <li>rooted in italian heritage</li>
            <li>making glasses the clear subject</li>
            <li>worldly and inclusive</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <span>Archive Occhiali</span><br>
            <li>says the most in the fewest words, more memorable</li>
            <li>implies a wide assortment of glasses, old and new</li>
            <li>archive implies a contemporary investigation of history</li>
            <li>occhiali, italian for glasses, communicates italian heritage</li>
            <li>usage of english and italian communicates a worldly and inclusive attitude</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Logo</h2>

        <h3>I also created a unique logo for the learning experience using the current business card, the instagram profile picture, and the environment of the store as inspiration. One important consideration was how true to the existing brand it should be, and where diversions should be made. Another consideration was how to balance the “modern” approach of using a digital interface while honoring their personality and heritage, which distinguishes Foto Veneta Ottica from mass produced glasses stores and distributors.</h3>

        <h3>Selecting the logo was particularly difficult but ultimately I chose to emphasize brand consistency, elegance, and timelessness with the classic frame silhouette over novelty and learning with the silhouette in draft 2. In hindsight I still struggle with this decision, but I think in both cases the concepts are strong. This decision was so difficult in part because concepts such as antiquity and modernity or the digital interface and eclectic store can be contradictory. While many of the ideas were not necessarily suited for the logo, they could still be explored in the comprehensives</h3>
        
        <h2>Comprehensives</h2>

        <h3>In this context comprehensives are advertisements or promotions for the cultural experience we are creating. I continued to explore many of the ideas from my logo ideation but adapted them into digital looping animations.</h3>

        <p>
            <span>Print posters</span>
            <br>A very simple and effective advertisement would be to make an old 60s or 70s style advertisement with one or two people wearing sunglasses in an intriguing way. The models would be centered in the ad, with a small logo for the sunglasses store. These old advertisements from armani, gucci, and prada are good examples of what this could look like. They excel at highlighting the role of the store: to pair the individual with their dream pair of glasses that suites them visually, symbolically, and intellectually. The posters could also be easily adapted for a digital context. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Digital moving animations</span>
            <br>These ads meant for digital media could be looping abstract animations that represent the guiding concepts. The animations could highlight the reasons that archive occhiali is such a rich and rewarding experience, such as its educational value.  
        </p>

        <h2>Interactive Interface</h2>

        <h3>While visiting museums in Milan, I found that digital interfaces were an exciting new method of communicating difficult concepts in engaging ways. I wanted to employ this method similarly to organize the massive stock and information about each pair. </h3>

        <ul>
            <span>Important considerations in the Design Process:</span><br>
            <li>improve existing store experience, not undermine or disrupt it</li>
            <li>provide space to learn about glasses culture without flaunting the novelty of digital screen</li>
            <li>accessible to all knowledge levels</li>
            <li>complement the store clerks rather than replace them: people provide the character and contribute to the cultural experience</li>
            <li>store clerks do the jobs that require a human touch, like helping select the right frames for the face shape</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <span>Visual goals</span><br>
            <li>maintain consistency with brand identity</li>
            <li>be visually understated, not meant to distract from the in-store experience</li>
            <li>be authentically digital rather than disguised as a drawer or cabinet</li>
            <li>adapt elements from the store for inspiration</li>

            <li>Ties glasses to fashion</li>
            <li>Glasses reflect the style of the individual</li>
            <li>Represent a more meaningful connection between customer and frames</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My second set of comprehensives consists of three concepts for dynamic animated posters. </h3>

            <br>Resembles a light sweep or sheen, revealing glimpses of the store. The glasses frames interact with the animation, drawing connections between the frames and newly illuminated information.

        <p>
            <span>Digital poster 2</span>
            <br>Simulating glasses’ capacity to enhance vision, this poster depicts the new perspective gained by “looking through a new lens.” I also explore visual aspects of the store through rectangular representations of drawers and display cases.

        <p>
            <span>Digital poster 3</span>
            <br>This poster alludes to the digital interface through an early computer-like animation. I explore elementary shapes as a representation of learning experiences that can be gained from visiting the store. The repeating frames reflect a large stock of inventory, but the orderly repetition indicates the significance of a singular pair.

        <h2>Interactive Interface</h2>

        <h3>The final element of the visual identity is a prototype for an interactive interface. To learn more about a specific pair of glasses that have stood out, the user can place them on the designated circular module and information comes into focus. For users who need more assistance finding a pair that suits them, the left menu filters by category. Once the user has found the glasses that interest them in the digital gallery, the store clerk can locate the glasses and provide personalized assistance.  </h3>

        <ul>
            <span>Constraints satisfied</span><br>
            <li>Displays descriptive, historical and cultural information</li>
            <li>Organizes huge amounts of information into digestible forms</li>
            <li>Categorization of frames is consistent with Foto Veneta Ottica’s website</li>
            <li>Strengthens the customers’ bond with the glasses and store</li>
            <li>The requisite that glasses be placed down ties the interface to the physical store</li>
            <li>Does not attempt to do artisanal tasks reserved for clerks</li>
            <li>Captures both modernity and antiquity</li>
            <li>Components such as the side menu take inspiration from elements of the store</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>It requires a concerted effort to foster personal connections with technology rather than allow it to detract from genuine experiences. Sometimes it even requires restraint from rushing to embrace technology’s conveniences. This prototype employs both functional and aesthetic features to be unobtrusive in its environment. Forcing the user to interact with the clerks and the physical glasses ties the interface closer to the frames, store, and culture. Through its formal qualities, it remains authentically digital while incorporating elements of the store's charm and vintage character. If I were to extend the prototype, I would create interactive infographics and other engaging methods of contextualizing the frames, better showcasing the learning potential and interactivity of the medium.</h3>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>

        <h3>Although the project's scope was extensive, I was able to accomplish a great deal within a short timeline. I hope what stands out from this project is my willingness and ambition to tackle truly difficult problems. Balancing modernity and antiquity, capturing personality, attempting mindful and cautious insertions of technology, and making buying experiences more meaningful through learning are the kinds of problems that excite me.</h3>
