                <p>is a designer and new media artist based in Portland, Oregon. He recently graduated from Whitman College majoring in Theory and Practice in Digital Design. The individually planned major combined new media art, computer science, and art history with a focus on modern art and architecture. The experimental major served as an unofficial model for the Human Centered Design major introduced the next year. Henry realized he was interested in design in highschool after taking a summer course at Sci-Arc. He uses processing, figma, and various coding languages to create interactive interfaces, reflecting his Brutalist inspired style. He is familiar with python, C++, java, and html/javascript. Henry hopes to explore a career in User Experience Design or Architecture.</p>

                    <!-- <h1>Music Event App</h1>
                    <p>This project was driven by a prompt to create an app for a specific music scene in your home city. The genre, as well as the animal mascot for the logo, were provided by a random generator. In this exercise I took deliberate care to push my own boundaries, strengthening practical skills to supplement my more conceptual liberal arts education. First, this being my biggest project to date, I created robust and flexible components and auto layouts with variants and properties to scale quicker and more elegantly. Secondly, I improved workflow by integrating chatgpt and plugins like Content Reel and Unsplash to provide the content of the site. This allowed me to concentrate more of my efforts on the layout. I also used Apple's open source Figma resources to make a share menu rather than recreate the wheel. Lastly, I approached this as a formal project. I developed components with tightly defined parameters to minimize the risk of misuse by others. I also documented the specs of my components as if I were handing it off to a developer. This approach sometimes meant sacrificing some creative freedom, as the prompt dictated the types of pages that were to be created. However, I still tried to implement my own ideas through the layout and design decisions. For example, I decided to represent artist name, album name, and location with primary color, secondary color, and outline respectively to maintain consistency throughout the app and increase clarity for the user. As the product is mostly technical, it reflects a departure from my typical design tendencies in recognition of my deficiencies. Through this project I was forced to adapt and in doing so discovered new techniques and styles that I wouldn’t have used previously.</p> -->

                        <p>In this project I used Microsoft Kinect to make a drawing program. I used a WebSocket to send JSON data over a server between a python program running the Kinect and an HTML/Javascript page serving as the user interface. Kinect and other technologies like virtual and augmented reality create new opportunities to innovate. I noticed that all drawing programs I have used, except maybe newer programs that use the apple pencil, don’t have the ability to dynamically change the traits of the brush while drawing. The apple pencil has the ability to change the stroke with the tilt of the pencil and the force used while drawing. Rather than use an external tool to toggle the brush characteristics, the body could be used instead. The kinect can discern between left hand and right hand, as well as whether the hand is open or closed, so these were the mechanisms that I used to dictate the brush. While you draw with your right hand, your horizontal positioning of your left hand is used to toggle between the possible variable traits. In this class we had a special emphasis on accessibility, so to make my drawing program accessible to a wider audience. I made it so that the left and right hands were not calibrated to a ‘standard’ wingspan or distance, it would be calibrated to the maximum wingspan of that specific user. This way a user would never have an issue reaching the edge of the frame while drawing etc.

                    <p>In the course Interactive Computer Graphics, we spent the majority of the semester working on a ray tracer that would simulate real lighting on spheres and planes. Using C++, we formed an understanding of vectors, and the equations necessary for ray-object intersection, direct and ambient lighting, and more. For my personal extension of the project, I decided to do texture mapping. With planes this is relatively straightforward, but with spheres it requires wrapping or mapping a two dimensional plane onto a sphere. This process was merely a technical exercise in math and computer science until I gained valuable insights later through an unlikely source. 
                        <br><br>
                        In an Art History course on the Art of Colonial India, I examined a French naval maritime map from the year 1789. In cartography back then they used the same equation but to reverse the process, turning the spherical space of earth and mapping it onto a two dimensional plane. The term for this organization of space on maps is called mercator projections. Mercator projections are frequently criticized for distortion, manipulating space near the poles to appear larger than it actually is. With Mercator Projections, there are two different methods of plotting your course. Rhumb lines, or loxodromes, are lines that maintain a constant angle from the lines of longitude and latitude. This was beneficial because it allowed ships to use a method called dead reckoning in which they would navigate in a straight line using the last known position, course, and speed. Although this method is practical with the technology available, it is not the shortest distance from point to point. Great Circle, or orthodromes, are the quickest way between two points on a sphere, however they are curved lines on a map using mercator projections and do not maintain a constant course. Maps, then, do not show objective truth like they were purported to. Along with the addition of details like the fleur de lis and the Paris meridian, it becomes clear that utilitarian and scientific maps also serve the purpose of naturalizing French possession  of India and justifying French colonization of India as objective, scientific truth. 
                        <br><br>
                        Raytracing, similarly, is taught as a somewhat scientific process, meant to recreate reality as accurately and objectively as possible. By using the same equation as the mercator projections, by extension it is subject to the same distortions. Likewise, the lighting equations are not necessarily picture perfect, they are simply the most realistic lighting we can achieve with the computing power we have available. As Engel argues, the perfect map with every detail would defeat the very purpose of cartography: to represent land for the sake of personal, social, and cultural means. I think this could just as easily be applied to ray tracers. The purpose of tools such as cartography and raytracing, is cultural just as much as utilitarian. This doesn’t diminish the achievement of coding a functioning raytracer, but it is also crucial to understand that even the most seemingly objective forms of media have cultural implications. One day I hope to extend my raytracer further, texture mapping images onto planes and spheres.
