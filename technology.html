                    <p>In this project I used Microsoft Kinect to make a drawing program. I used a WebSocket to send JSON data over a server between a python program running the Kinect and an HTML/Javascript page serving as the user interface. Kinect and other technologies like virtual and augmented reality create new opportunities to innovate. I noticed that all drawing programs I have used, except maybe newer programs that use the apple pencil, don’t have the ability to dynamically change the traits of the brush while drawing. The apple pencil has the ability to change the stroke with the tilt of the pencil and the force used while drawing. Rather than use an external tool to toggle the brush characteristics, the body could be used instead. The kinect can discern between left hand and right hand, as well as whether the hand is open or closed, so these were the mechanisms that I used to dictate the brush. While you draw with your right hand, your horizontal positioning of your left hand is used to toggle between the possible variable traits. In this class we had a special emphasis on accessibility, so to make my drawing program accessible to a wider audience. I made it so that the left and right hands were not calibrated to a ‘standard’ wingspan or distance, it would be calibrated to the maximum wingspan of that specific user. This way a user would never have an issue reaching the edge of the frame while drawing etc.

                    <p>In the course Interactive Computer Graphics, we spent the majority of the semester working on a ray tracer that would simulate real lighting on spheres and planes. Using C++, we formed an understanding of vectors, and the equations necessary for ray-object intersection, direct and ambient lighting, and more. For my personal extension of the project, I decided to do texture mapping. With planes this is relatively straightforward, but with spheres it requires wrapping or mapping a two dimensional plane onto a sphere. This process was merely a technical exercise in math and computer science until I gained valuable insights later through an unlikely source. 
                        <br><br>
                        In an Art History course on the Art of Colonial India, I examined a French naval maritime map from the year 1789. In cartography back then they used the same equation but to reverse the process, turning the spherical space of earth and mapping it onto a two dimensional plane. The term for this organization of space on maps is called mercator projections. Mercator projections are frequently criticized for distortion, manipulating space near the poles to appear larger than it actually is. With Mercator Projections, there are two different methods of plotting your course. Rhumb lines, or loxodromes, are lines that maintain a constant angle from the lines of longitude and latitude. This was beneficial because it allowed ships to use a method called dead reckoning in which they would navigate in a straight line using the last known position, course, and speed. Although this method is practical with the technology available, it is not the shortest distance from point to point. Great Circle, or orthodromes, are the quickest way between two points on a sphere, however they are curved lines on a map using mercator projections and do not maintain a constant course. Maps, then, do not show objective truth like they were purported to. Along with the addition of details like the fleur de lis and the Paris meridian, it becomes clear that utilitarian and scientific maps also serve the purpose of naturalizing French possession  of India and justifying French colonization of India as objective, scientific truth. 
                        <br><br>
                        Raytracing, similarly, is taught as a somewhat scientific process, meant to recreate reality as accurately and objectively as possible. By using the same equation as the mercator projections, by extension it is subject to the same distortions. Likewise, the lighting equations are not necessarily picture perfect, they are simply the most realistic lighting we can achieve with the computing power we have available. As Engel argues, the perfect map with every detail would defeat the very purpose of cartography: to represent land for the sake of personal, social, and cultural means. I think this could just as easily be applied to ray tracers. The purpose of tools such as cartography and raytracing, is cultural just as much as utilitarian. This doesn’t diminish the achievement of coding a functioning raytracer, but it is also crucial to understand that even the most seemingly objective forms of media have cultural implications. One day I hope to extend my raytracer further, texture mapping images onto planes and spheres.

                    <p>In this assignment of my Human Computer Interaction course, I worked on a team to develop a rudimentary augmented or virtual reality program. Initially very ambitious, I proposed that we design a program that takes camera data from the iphone and then performs calculations in real time to convert it to an ASCII image. ASCII art is typically images composed of ASCII characters. The user would see nothing but a pixelated ASCII world, and they would have to navigate space in a way they have never experienced before. The intention behind the program was to challenge the major assumptions we have about reality, reconsider and reappreciate the senses we use every day, and possibly even consider the existence of senses we aren’t even conscious of. In the beginning, we wanted to do all of this through HTML and javascript, but with limited knowledge we had to settle with more of a prototype. It’s often difficult for me to compromise on my original plan. Ultimately, though, the important takeaway was that effectively communicating the concept was more important than flawlessly executing the initial vision for the project. To give the sensation of our initial concept, we took a 360 degree photo of our school library and ran the image through an ASCII generator (https://ascii-generator.site), transforming the original image into monochrome pixels. We then uploaded both images into A-Frame, a simple online tool for creating virtual and augmented reality programs. We mapped each image onto the inside of a sphere, giving the sensation of being surrounded by the new environment. We provided a button that would transition between the original image and the ASCII image when the user looked in its direction. The end result is sensorially jarring and I think still achieves the initial goal of making the user question their assumptions about the ways in which we experience the world. </p>

                        Another assignment in my Human Computer Interaction course, we worked in groups to redesign an existing website and make it compatible for three different screen sizes: the apple watch, the laptop, and the multi touch display. I chose to tackle the large multi touch display because it is an unconventional and less widely used screen format. It seemed like a wonderful design challenge to speculate and predict how something like this might be used, and how best to layout an interface for it. Using the example of the Microsoft surface hub, I saw that the screen is split into four parts, which was a useful limitation.
                        <br><br>
                        The format meant that you would be able to fit a lot of information onto one screen, but it meant that you would have to be wise about how you presented that information so as not to overwhelm the user. Many of the decisions had to do with the usage of space and the necessary information. As shown in my mood board, I used TV and multi tasking layouts for inspiration as they organize large lists and a lot of information in a way that is still understandable to the user, and in ways that are still viewable from further distances and close proximity. Consequently I chose to use the guidelines created by the four screens and divide my layout into four parts, giving us four smartphone-like ratio screens to work with. I decided to make a main page and three other interchangeable pages. As interesting as having text and images that span between screens would be, in this case it would be impractical and unpredictable which parts would be cut off by the dividers, as well as inappropriate and distracting from the useful information on the Whitman computer science website. While the dense pages with large paragraphs are still necessary for the website, I found that pages with images and lists lent themselves better to being seen from distances and from close up. The screen is large but meant to be viewed from a distance, so text and images needed to compromise on size. For many of the pages the concept was to have primary information ready to be viewed from a distance and the secondary information with much more detail to be available in expandable modules if needed. 
                        <br><br>
                        As for the aesthetics of the project, as a group we decided to follow the example of the Whitman website fairly closely, focussing more on functionality and compatibility with various screen sizes than with the look of the website. Many assets of the design process could be shared and reused between members of the group while others had to be completely reworked in order to fit the screen. Overall, I wanted the website to still look and feel familiar while making use of this new format. Compared to the other screen dimensions, this allowed for a lot of flexibility in terms of how to display the information. However, when given an exciting new format like this, it is important to keep the information digestible and not overdo the possibilities of a larger screen. The website is similar to the current Whitman website in that it is professional and welcoming, but this new site allows for a better system of organization and it makes far more information accessible at any given time in a way that is still flexible. The end result is an interface with four simultaneous pages that can be mixed and matched freely, while still being resemblant of a typical website.
                        <br><br>
                        I had several ideas that I wanted to incorporate that I wasn’t able to implement within the timeline and with the skills I had at the time. If I could build on the project, I would make the prototype have alternating tabs so that any tab of the design could be placed anywhere on the screen. I would have also liked to make variable list components that would expand when tapped and resize the items in the list accordingly. For a more immersive prototype, it would take a deeper knowledge of figma components and auto layout. These more complicated interactions are what we would improve upon in our next iteration. 
                    </p>

                        <div class="product"><img src="files/multiTouch.png" alt="Image 1"></div>

                    <p>
                        For our final group project, we were tasked with redesigning and extending one of our previous projects. Now with a different group of team members, we worked not only to improve the interactions and hone our Figma skills, but to make a more cohesive design system shared between all of our fairly different approaches in the first iteration. I was now assigned with the apple watch screen. My interest was to match the visuals for all dimensions in order to achieve consistency. The Apple Watch dimensions made it difficult to match with the others because of its small resolution. 
                        <br><br>
                        Again the decisions came down to the organization of space, but this time with very different constraints. I found that many of the same design solutions I used on the multi touch display solved similar problems on the apple watch, while others did not. I repurposed certain elements from the laptop and multi touch display and had to reformat them for the small screen. This meant the icons and images had to be much larger in proportion to the rest of the screen, descriptions had to be more concise, but most importantly the page layout had to compensate for the lack of real estate. In the multi touch display, I separated the layout into the four separate pages to make the layout more understandable and digestible, but on the apple watch it served to extend the space the watch had to offer. On a small device it is much more difficult to tap or click on the item you want to press, so I made the navigation use swiping as the primary means of navigating between pages. For the more detailed aspects of the website, such as the course catalog, I used expanding modules. They compress a huge amount of information into a very small list of course titles. These features were a great opportunity to practice figma skills including prototyping and using components and variants. And, because we reused and shared many of the same assets, we were able to achieve a cohesive style for the website between the three screens.

                    <p>This project was driven by a prompt to create an app for a specific music scene in your home city. The genre, as well as the animal mascot for the logo, were provided by a random generator. In this exercise I took deliberate care to push my own boundaries, strengthening practical skills to supplement my more conceptual liberal arts education. First, this being my biggest project to date, I created robust and flexible components and auto layouts with variants and properties to scale quicker and more elegantly. Secondly, I improved workflow by integrating chatgpt and plugins like Content Reel and Unsplash to provide the content of the site. This allowed me to concentrate more of my efforts on the layout. I also used Apple's open source Figma resources to make a share menu rather than recreate the wheel. Lastly, I approached this as a formal project. I developed components with tightly defined parameters to minimize the risk of misuse by others. I also documented the specs of my components as if I were handing it off to a developer. This approach sometimes meant sacrificing some creative freedom, as the prompt dictated the types of pages that were to be created. However, I still tried to implement my own ideas through the layout and design decisions. For example, I decided to represent artist name, album name, and location with primary color, secondary color, and outline respectively to maintain consistency throughout the app and increase clarity for the user. As the product is mostly technical, it reflects a departure from my typical design tendencies in recognition of my deficiencies. Through this project I was forced to adapt and in doing so discovered new techniques and styles that I wouldn’t have used previously.</p>
