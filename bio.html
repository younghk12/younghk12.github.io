            <p>I am searching for roles in user experience (UX) / user interface (UI) / digital product design, involving elements of information architecture and brand identity design. My ideal design role would be breaking down complexity, whether literally—organizing and clarifying large amounts of information in a design layout—or more abstractly—using visual storytelling to communicate complicated ideas (such as the gravity of an unfamiliar new technology). I want to collaborate closely with software developers (and others from all types of disciplines) to make thoughtful digital products. 
            <br><br>
            My design background is slightly unorthodox, however planning my own major allowed me to get the most out of my liberal arts education. Art and art history gave me a conceptual foundation for design with the visual principals, the skills to do in-depth visual analyses, as well as an overall understanding of visual and idealistic trends. Expanding outside of the theory, I sought out practical experience with different softwares from design and cs classes; computer science makes me suited for roles in software and makes me an effective collaborator with software developers. Admittedly, design software was the weakest link in my education, but I have since augmented with several online resources. Through the liberal arts I explored a wide range of academics, drawing connections between assumed distinct subjects, discovering new ways in which they inform one another, and gaining the soft skills for collaboration across these disciplines. </p>
