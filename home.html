                    <p>In the final for my visual merchandising class in Milan, we applied our new knowledge of fashion window displays. After analyzing a fashion brand of our choosing, we designed a window display in accordance with our diagnosis and their brand image. In this project I chose to analyze Uniqlo, a Japanese brand offering colorful basics. After researching the brand, their customer persona, and their competitors, I decided that Uniqlo could benefit the most from more recognizability and brand loyalty. Relating to the urban market through the aesthetics of their city could develop a sense of loyalty, and utilizing the flexibility of their wide color ranges could create striking harmonies by complementing the colors of their cities visual identity. With my window display, I used photoshop to recreate a closed back diorama-like display of the Milanese subway system. I used a mannequin dressed in red clothing and a blue Uniqlo sign to complement the red and yellow coloring of the subway. I photoshopped all of this into the existing Uniqlo store Milan to make it as realistic as possible.

                            <h3>Figma</h3>

                    <p>As I discussed in my manifesto, much of my work contemplates the idea of pattern. These two processing sketches particularly exhibit these concepts. The first, random grit, was adapted from Tim Rodenbrokerâ€™s exercise to mimic the dirt and grime on old film. My approach was to first make a sketch that would draw random shapes, combinations of straight lines and bezier curves, within the allotted dimensions. The result of this stepping stone, to me at least, ended up being more meaningful than the end goal of the exercise. The program endlessly creates diverse randomized shapes, and the pattern that forms is more impactful than any one random shape. The sequence turns rigid, static shapes into a turbulent yet quasi-organic movement. The impermanence of the shapes forces you to see design not as a single, tangible object, but instead a set of rules or a design system with an infinite output. Only by watching the sequence can you start to understand the rules that govern the pattern.
                    <br><br>
                    The second sketch takes a slightly different approach. This colorful grid is a project I have spent many iterations improving with the goal of experimenting and refining. Through this project I have experimented with data structures, color, and interactions, all confined within a grid. While making a grid is not the most difficult or original undertaking within creative coding, the grid is significant because to me it represents a foundation to build from while creating a sense of the infinite. In combination with the mouse interaction which controls the size of the grid, it brings a new dimension to this concept of scale and the sublime. The grid itself isnâ€™t visually stunning, but it allows the smaller details to shine. I intentionally saved the color information in a data structure so that it could be updated independently from the interaction with the mouse position. In other words the interaction remains smooth and fluid, while the changes in color are choppy like archaic/rudimentary technology.
                    <br><br>
                    Similar to the principles of Gestalt psychology, in both of my sketches there is an emphasis on the relationship between parts and the whole. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, whether the â€˜wholeâ€™ is the sequence that forms, or the visual combined with an interaction. In both sketches I also experiment with the aesthetics and tropes of old digital media. I think it is important to reflect on the course technology has taken over time, and to be more critical about what we really want out of it.

                    <p>In this project I used Microsoft Kinect to make a drawing program. I used a WebSocket to send JSON data over a server between a python program running the Kinect and an HTML/Javascript page serving as the user interface. Kinect and other technologies like virtual and augmented reality create new opportunities to innovate. I noticed that all drawing programs I have used, except maybe newer programs that use the apple pencil, donâ€™t have the ability to dynamically change the traits of the brush while drawing. The apple pencil has the ability to change the stroke with the tilt of the pencil and the force used while drawing. Rather than use an external tool to toggle the brush characteristics, the body could be used instead. The kinect can discern between left hand and right hand, as well as whether the hand is open or closed, so these were the mechanisms that I used to dictate the brush. While you draw with your right hand, your horizontal positioning of your left hand is used to toggle between the possible variable traits. In this class we had a special emphasis on accessibility, so to make my drawing program accessible to a wider audience. I made it so that the left and right hands were not calibrated to a â€˜standardâ€™ wingspan or distance, it would be calibrated to the maximum wingspan of that specific user. This way a user would never have an issue reaching the edge of the frame while drawing etc.

                    <p>In the course Interactive Computer Graphics, we spent the majority of the semester working on a ray tracer that would simulate real lighting on spheres and planes. Using C++, we formed an understanding of vectors, and the equations necessary for ray-object intersection, direct and ambient lighting, and more. For my personal extension of the project, I decided to do texture mapping. With planes this is relatively straightforward, but with spheres it requires wrapping or mapping a two dimensional plane onto a sphere. This process was merely a technical exercise in math and computer science until I gained valuable insights later through an unlikely source. 
                        <br><br>
                        In an Art History course on the Art of Colonial India, I examined a French naval maritime map from the year 1789. In cartography back then they used the same equation but to reverse the process, turning the spherical space of earth and mapping it onto a two dimensional plane. The term for this organization of space on maps is called mercator projections. Mercator projections are frequently criticized for distortion, manipulating space near the poles to appear larger than it actually is. With Mercator Projections, there are two different methods of plotting your course. Rhumb lines, or loxodromes, are lines that maintain a constant angle from the lines of longitude and latitude. This was beneficial because it allowed ships to use a method called dead reckoning in which they would navigate in a straight line using the last known position, course, and speed. Although this method is practical with the technology available, it is not the shortest distance from point to point. Great Circle, or orthodromes, are the quickest way between two points on a sphere, however they are curved lines on a map using mercator projections and do not maintain a constant course. Maps, then, do not show objective truth like they were purported to. Along with the addition of details like the fleur de lis and the Paris meridian, it becomes clear that utilitarian and scientific maps also serve the purpose of naturalizing French possession  of India and justifying French colonization of India as objective, scientific truth. 
                        <br><br>
                        Raytracing, similarly, is taught as a somewhat scientific process, meant to recreate reality as accurately and objectively as possible. By using the same equation as the mercator projections, by extension it is subject to the same distortions. Likewise, the lighting equations are not necessarily picture perfect, they are simply the most realistic lighting we can achieve with the computing power we have available. As Engel argues, the perfect map with every detail would defeat the very purpose of cartography: to represent land for the sake of personal, social, and cultural means. I think this could just as easily be applied to ray tracers. The purpose of tools such as cartography and raytracing, is cultural just as much as utilitarian. This doesnâ€™t diminish the achievement of coding a functioning raytracer, but it is also crucial to understand that even the most seemingly objective forms of media have cultural implications. One day I hope to extend my raytracer further, texture mapping images onto planes and spheres.
